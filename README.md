## Welcome to GitHub Pages
I am using a GitHub Pages theme

Open the file named README.md.
Remove the template text that was added to the README.md when you selected your theme.
In the README.md file include at least the following two lines: # Hello World! and My name is GITHUB_USERNAME. Bonus points for including more information.
When you are finished, save your changes and close the text editor.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/elinas1966/YOUR-USERNAME.GITHUB.IO/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/elinas1966/YOUR-USERNAME.GITHUB.IO/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
